# 👋 Hi, I'm Nick Ren 🌱

**Full-Stack Software Engineer | Systems Thinker | AI-Driven Builder**

I’m a former **Mechanical / MEP Design Engineer** who transitioned into software engineering to build smarter, more scalable systems.  
I love turning complex workflows into clean, usable software — especially where **data, automation, and AI** can create real impact.

Currently focused on building full-stack applications with **React + Python**, and exploring **AI-assisted development** and automation.

## 🔭 What I Do

- Build full-stack web applications (frontend → backend → database)
- Design REST APIs & relational data models
- Create secure authentication & user flows
- Apply **systems thinking** from engineering to software
- Experiment with **AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, prompt workflows)** to ship faster

## 👯 My Background

Before tech, I spent years designing **real-world building systems** across healthcare, education, and commercial projects.  
That experience shaped how I think:

> **Design → Test → Improve → Scale**

Now I apply the same mindset to software.
